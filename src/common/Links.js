      "My name is Selvam. The first time I saw Santhosh in college, I thought he was okay in technology. But I really admired his skills; unbelievably, he has extraordinary knowledge in tech. He is doing intern work like someone with 3 to 4 years of experience. He has an extraordinary future in the tech world and a good tendency to help others. These words really come from the bottomÂ ofÂ myÂ heart.",
